# iPad Navigation Improvements

## Overview
This branch (`ipad`) contains fixes for iPad navigation behavior to ensure consistent user experience across iPhone and iPad devices.

## Problem
The original app used `NavigationView` which on iPad automatically creates a split-view interface where:
- The master view (HomeView) becomes a sidebar
- Users couldn't easily return to the home screen
- The home screen was hidden behind a menu button
- Navigation behavior was inconsistent between iPhone and iPad

## Solution
Replaced `NavigationView` with `NavigationStack` (iOS 16+) to provide consistent navigation behavior across all devices.

## Changes Made

### Core Navigation Updates
1. **HomeView.swift**
   - Replaced `NavigationView` with `NavigationStack`
   - Added `.navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.large)` for better iPad experience
   - Ensures home screen is always accessible

2. **ManageDecksView.swift**
   - Updated NavigationView to NavigationStack in modal sheets
   - Consistent behavior for deck management

3. **ExportImportView.swift**
   - Updated to NavigationStack
   - Replaced deprecated `navigationBarItems` with modern `toolbar` API

4. **ImageImportView.swift**
   - Updated to NavigationStack
   - Modernized toolbar implementation

5. **DeckView.swift**
   - Updated MoveCardsSheet to use NavigationStack
   - Replaced deprecated navigationBarItems

### API Modernization
- Replaced deprecated `navigationBarItems` with `toolbar` API
- Updated to use `ToolbarItem` with proper placement
- Improved compatibility with iOS 16+ navigation system

## Benefits
- ✅ Consistent navigation behavior on iPhone and iPad
- ✅ Home screen always accessible (no hidden sidebar)
- ✅ Modern iOS 16+ navigation APIs
- ✅ Better user experience on larger screens
- ✅ Future-proof navigation implementation

## Testing
Test on both iPhone and iPad simulators/devices to verify:
1. Home screen is always visible and accessible
2. Navigation flows work consistently
3. Modal sheets display properly
4. Back navigation works as expected
5. No sidebar behavior on iPad

## Compatibility
- Requires iOS 16.0+ (already the app's minimum target)
- Uses modern SwiftUI navigation APIs
- Backward compatible with existing navigation patterns
